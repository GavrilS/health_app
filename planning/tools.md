# Database

We will use the PostgreSQL because it fits the app's needs well. Since most pages will be in the format of text containing headings, we can structure the data as a json object, where we can have each heading be a key and the relevant piece of information will be the value.

We will also have a table with references for each page to a gallery of images/videos that are relevant for it.

# Database v2

For the database we will use MariaDB.

# Back-End

The back-end will be written on Python. We will also use Flask to build the web app.

# Front-End

For the front-end we will use JavaScript for specific site elements functionality and for the presentation layer we will use HTML/CSS.

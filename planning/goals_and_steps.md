# GOALS

1. Build an application that can provide information about nutrition, mental and physical activities to build a healthy body and mind. The main goal is to provide a service that is like an encyclopedia for healthy living.

2. Build an user specific views with whatever information they want to have a quick access to. This will require users to be registered. Additionally, allow users to add additional information to be saved to the indices, but it needs to be structured in the appropriate way.

# STEPS

1. Start by doing research in nutrition. Collect information and build an index for the nutrition section of the application.

2. Repeat the above step for physical activities.

3. Similarly, build an index for mental activities.

* Steps 1-3 are going to need a long research so we can start here and build a base index for all three sections and then move with the rest of the steps while periodically enhancing the indices.

4. Build the web app and create the main page along with the admin page; the admin page will be used by the admins to be able to update the indices with new information or remove unneseccary data. (includes html/css styling)

5. Create pages to show the different categories of data - nutrition, physical activities and mental activities and structure it (includes html/css styling)

6. Build the user specific funtionality
